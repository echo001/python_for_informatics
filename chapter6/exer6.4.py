#Exercise 6.4  There is a string method called count that is similar to the function
#				in the previous exercise. Read the documentation of this method at docs.python.
#				org/library/string.html and write an invocation that counts the number of
#				times the letter a occurs in 'banana'.

strings = 'banana'
searchfor = 'n'
counter = strings.count(searchfor)

print(counter)
